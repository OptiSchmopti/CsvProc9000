**CsvProc9000** is a light-weight, rule-based CSV-Processor. It watches a given Inbox-Folder for you and processes - based on the given rules - any new CSV-File that it catches and outputs it anywhere you want.

## üñ•Ô∏è Installation

Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/OptiSchmopti/CsvProc9000/releases) and select a Release that you want to use. Generally the lastest release is recommended, because it has all the latest Fixes and Features.  
Attached to the Release you'll find a `CsvProc9000-vX_X_X.zip` which contains:

- `appsettings.json`  - configuration file for CsvProc9000
- `CsvProc9000.exe`   - a self-contained binary containing everything that CsvProc9000 needs to run. No other software is needed
- `CreateService.bat` - a Batch-File which will create and run a Windows-Service named "CsvProc9000" with the Mode "Automatic"

Before running `CreateService.bat` you should make sure that your configuration is the way you want it to be. If there are any issues with starting the service, check out the log-file that is generated in the location where the `CsvProc9000.exe` is, in the folder `logs`. Common issues are:

- Forgot to configure the Inbox/Outbox folders

## üñ±Ô∏è Update

To update the service you can simply do the following steps:

1. Stop the Service
2. Replace the `.exe` file with the new one
3. Change the Configuration according to any breaking changes, if any
4. Start the Service again

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

CsvProc9000 is heavily dependent on it's configuration, because otherwise it wouldn't know how you'd like it to behave.  
Here's an example configuration with information what everything does:

Based on this configuration, here is a simple example on how this configuration would be applied:

On the left side you can see the input and on the right the output.  
Based on the rules, only the 3rd row meets all conditions (`SomeField`=`SomeValue` and `SomeOtherField`=`1337`).  
Because of that all other rows, but the 3rd, are unaffected by any changes. In the 3rd you can see, that in the Output, `SomeOtherField` got changed to the value `42` and a new field `Other Field` with the value `123` has been added. Every other row has an empty value for this new field.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Developing

To develop and work with CsvProc9000 you just need to clone this Repo somewhere on your PC and then open the Solution or the complete Source-Folder (under `src`) with your favorite IDE. No additional tools required.  
  
Before you can start, you should restore all NuGet-Packages using `dotnet restore` if that's not done for you by your IDE.
